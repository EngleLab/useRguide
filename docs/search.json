    "text": "What does reproducibility mean?\nReproducibility means that all data processing and analysis steps can be fully reproduced using only the original raw data files and the execution of the R scripts. There are different levels of reproducibility (I made these up):\n\nPartially reproducible - only some data processing and analysis steps can be reproduced, which may be due to a lack of original raw data files, the “just get it done” approach, or the use of proprietary and non-reproducible software.\nMinimally reproducible (acceptable) - all data processing and analysis steps can be reproduced on any research team members computer without any modifications needed.\nModerately reproducible (desired) - meets the minimal level plus other people not involved in the research project can reproduce the steps with minimal modifications.\nHighly reproducible (good luck!) - fully reproducible without major modifications needed by people not involved in the research project 5 - 10+ years from now.\n\nA minimal level of reproducibility is still acceptable, as achieving more requires significant time and effort. We should strive for a moderate amount of reproducibility but achieving it requires more than just writing code. Your code must be organized, easy to understand, and include notes and documentation. Even if you or someone else attempts to reproduce your steps in the future, they can modify the code to make it work. The highest level of reproducibility is difficult to achieve due to software and code updates. Your code may only work with the current version of R or other packages. There are solutions to this problem of software and code updates, but who knows if those will work in the future!\n\nSimply using R for data analysis does not guarantee that your workflow is reproducible. In fact, there are many non-reproducible ways to use R. To ensure at least a moderate level of reproducibility, consider the following criteria (this is not an exhaustive list):\n\nYour statistical analysis (the final step) can be fully reproduced from the raw data files and your R scripts\nYour code can be reproduced on other computers without any modifications\nYour data and R scripts are organized and documented in a way that makes them easily understandable\n\nThis last criterion is extremely important, but is often overlooked. If others cannot understand your workflow, then it is not moderately reproducible. Therefore, it is important to take the time and think about the organization of your project, files, data, and scripts.",

    "section": "Mediation",
    "text": "Mediation\nMediation analysis is similar to hierarchical regression, however it allows us to test whether the effect of a predictor variable, on the dependent variable, “goes through” a mediator variable. This effect that “goes through” the mediator variable is called the indirect effect; whereas any effect of the predictor variable that does not “go through” the mediator is called the direct effect where:\nTotal Effect = Direct Effect + Indirect Effect\nWe are parsing the variance explained by the predictor variable into direct and indirect effects. Here are some possibilities for the outcome:\n\nFull Mediation: The total effect of the predictor variable can be fully explained by the indirect effect. The mediator fully explains the effect of the predictor variable on the dependent variable. Direct effect = 0, indirect effect != 0.\nPartial Mediation: The total effect of the predictor variable can be partially explained by the indirect effect. The mediator only partially explains the effect of the predictor variable on the dependent variable. Direct effect != 0, indirect effect != 0.\nNo Mediation: The total effect of the predictor variable can not be explained by the indirect effect; there is no indirect effect at all. Direct effect != 0, indirect effect = 0.\n\nThere are two general ways to perform a mediation analysis in R.\n\nThe standard regression method\nPath analysis\n\nRegression\nThe regression method requires multiple regression models because we have two dependent variables in the mode - the mediation and the outcome measure. The mediator acts as both an independent variable and dependent variable in the model. Because regression requires only one dependent variable, we cannot test the full model in one regression model. Instead, we have to test the different pieces of the model one at a time. We also need to perform a test on the indirect effect itself, which will require a separate model.\nIn order to evaluate the standardize coefficients (which is often times most useful), we need to first convert the the variables into z-scores. This is fairly straightforward but does require some extra code. A z-score is standardized score on the scale of standard deviation units and is calculated as:\nz-score = (raw score - mean) / sd\nWe can create new columns representing the z-scores using mutate() from the dplyr package.\n\ndata_mediation &lt;- happiness_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(Happiness_z = \n           (Happiness - mean(Happiness)) / sd(Happiness),\n         Social_Support_z = \n           (Social_Support - mean(Social_Support)) / sd(Social_Support),\n         Emotion_Regulation_z = \n           (Emotion_Regulation - mean(Emotion_Regulation)) / sd(Emotion_Regulation))\n\nThe standard regression model typically involves three regression models and a model testing the indirect effect.\n\nA model with the total effect: dv ~ iv\n\n\n\nreg_total &lt;- lm(Happiness_z ~ Social_Support_z, \n                data = data_mediation)\n\n\nA model with the effect of the predictor on the mediator: m ~ iv\n\n\n\nreg_med &lt;- lm(Emotion_Regulation_z ~ Social_Support_z, \n              data = data_mediation)\n\n\nA model with the direct effect and the effect of the mediator: dv ~ iv + m\n\n\n\nreg_direct &lt;- lm(Happiness_z ~ Emotion_Regulation_z + Social_Support_z, \n                 data = data_mediation)\n\n\nA statistical test of the indirect effect: mediation::mediate()\n\n\n\nlibrary(mediation)\n\nmodel_mediation &lt;- mediate(reg_med, reg_direct,\n                           treat = \"Social_Support_z\",\n                           mediator = \"Emotion_Regulation_z\",\n                           boot = TRUE, sims = 1000, \n                           boot.ci.type = \"bca\")\n## Running nonparametric bootstrap\n\nFor simplicity, we will use the modeloutput package to display the regression output\n\nregression_tables(reg_total, reg_direct)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Summary: Happiness_z\n\n\nModel\nR2\n\nR2 adj.\nΔR2\n\nΔF\ndf1\ndf2\np\nBIC\nBF\nP(Model|Data)\n\n\n\n\nH1\n0.187\n0.181\n\n\n\n\n\n413.995\n\n\n\n\nH2\n0.261\n0.251\n0.074\n14.944\n1 \n149 \n&lt;0.001\n404.491\n1.16 × 102\n\n0.991\n\n\n\n\nH1: Happiness_z ~ Social_Support_z; N = 152\n\n\nH2: Happiness_z ~ Emotion_Regulation_z + Social_Support_z; N = 152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANOVA Table: Happiness_z\n\n\nModel\nTerm\nSum of Squares\ndf\nMean Square\nF\np\n\n\n\n\nH1\nRegression\n 28.207\n  2 \n14.103\n34.456\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH1\nResidual\n122.793\n150 \n 0.819\n\n\n\n\nH2\nRegression\n 15.276\n  3 \n 5.092\n26.302\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH2\nResidual\n111.600\n149 \n 0.749\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1: Happiness_z ~ Social_Support_z; N = 152\n\n\nH2: Happiness_z ~ Emotion_Regulation_z + Social_Support_z; N = 152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression Coefficients: Happiness_z\n\n\nModel\nTerm\nUnstandardized\nStandardized\nt\ndf\np\n\n\nb\n95% CI\nβ\n95% CI\nSE\n\n\n\n\nH1\n(Intercept)\n0.000\n−0.145 — 0.145\n0.000\n−0.145 — 0.145\n0.073\n0.000\n150 \n    1.000\n\n\nH1\nSocial_Support_z\n0.432\n 0.287 — 0.578\n0.432\n 0.287 — 0.578\n0.074\n5.870\n150 \n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH2\n(Intercept)\n0.000\n−0.139 — 0.139\n0.000\n−0.139 — 0.139\n0.070\n0.000\n149 \n    1.000\n\n\nH2\nEmotion_Regulation_z\n0.350\n 0.171 — 0.530\n0.350\n 0.171 — 0.530\n0.091\n3.866\n149 \n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH2\nSocial_Support_z\n0.212\n 0.033 — 0.391\n0.212\n 0.033 — 0.391\n0.091\n2.335\n149 \n    0.021\n\n\n\n\nH1: Happiness_z ~ Social_Support_z; N = 152\n\n\nH2: Happiness_z ~ Emotion_Regulation_z + Social_Support_z; N = 152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregression_tables(reg_med)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Summary: Emotion_Regulation_z\n\n\nModel\nR2\n\nR2 adj.\nBIC\n\n\n\nH1\n0.396\n0.392\n368.722\n\n\nH1: Emotion_Regulation_z ~ Social_Support_z; N = 152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANOVA Table: Emotion_Regulation_z\n\n\nModel\nTerm\nSum of Squares\ndf\nMean Square\nF\np\n\n\n\n\nH1\nRegression\n59.837\n  2 \n29.918\n98.456\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH1\nResidual\n91.163\n150 \n 0.608\n\n\n\n\n\nH1: Emotion_Regulation_z ~ Social_Support_z; N = 152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression Coefficients: Emotion_Regulation_z\n\n\nModel\nTerm\nUnstandardized\nStandardized\nt\ndf\np\n\n\nb\n95% CI\nβ\n95% CI\nSE\n\n\n\n\nH1\n(Intercept)\n0.000\n−0.125 — 0.125\n0.000\n−0.125 — 0.125\n0.063\n0.000\n150 \n    1.000\n\n\nH1\nSocial_Support_z\n0.630\n 0.504 — 0.755\n0.630\n 0.504 — 0.755\n0.063\n9.922\n150 \n&lt;0.001\n\n\n\nH1: Emotion_Regulation_z ~ Social_Support_z; N = 152\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we can display the result of the indirect mediation analysis\n\nmodel_parameters(model_mediation) |&gt;\n  table_theme()\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nEstimate\nCI\nCI_low\nCI_high\np\n\n\n\nACME\n0.221\n0.95\n0.110\n0.351\n0.000\n\n\nADE\n0.212\n0.95\n0.053\n0.360\n0.014\n\n\nTotal Effect\n0.432\n0.95\n0.317\n0.557\n0.000\n\n\nProp.

    "text": "Moderation\nAnother type of multiple regression model is the moderation analysis. The concept of moderation in regression is analogous to the concept of an interaction in ANOVA. The idea here is that the relationship (correlation or slope) between two variables changes as a function of another variable, called the moderator. As the values on the moderator variable increases, the correlation or slope might increase or decrease. The moderator can be either continuous or categorical.\nIn our happiness data, we can test whether the relationship between chocolate consumption and happiness is moderated by the type of chocolate consumed. In this case, type of chocolate is a categorical variable: White, milk, dark, or alcohol.\nIt is highly advisable to first “center” the predictor and moderator variables. Centering refers to centering the scores around the mean (making the mean = 0). This can simply be done by subtracting out the mean from each score. We can do this with mutate() from the dplyr package.\nSince type of chocolate is categorical we do not need to center it.\n\ndata_mod &lt;- happiness_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(Chocolate_Consumed_c = \n           Chocolate_Consumption - mean(Chocolate_Consumption))\n\nModel\n\nmodel_null &lt;- lm(Happiness ~ Chocolate_Consumed_c + Type_of_Chocolate, \n                 data = data_mod)\n\nmodel_moderation &lt;- lm(Happiness ~ Chocolate_Consumed_c * Type_of_Chocolate, \n                       data = data_mod)\n\n\nregression_tables(model_null, model_moderation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Summary: Happiness\n\n\nModel\nR2\n\nR2 adj.\nΔR2\n\nΔF\ndf1\ndf2\np\nBIC\nBF\nP(Model|Data)\n\n\n\n\nH1\n0.174\n0.151\n\n\n\n\n\n1491.733\n\n\n\n\nH2\n0.223\n0.186\n0.050\n3.061\n3 \n144 \n0.030\n1497.409\n5.85 × 10−2\n\n0.055\n\n\n\n\nH1: Happiness ~ Chocolate_Consumed_c + Type_of_Chocolate; N = 152\n\n\nH2: Happiness ~ Chocolate_Consumed_c * Type_of_Chocolate; N = 152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANOVA Table: Happiness\n\n\nModel\nTerm\nSum of Squares\ndf\nMean Square\nF\np\n\n\n\n\nH1\nRegression\n250273.269\n  5 \n50054.654\n7.729\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH1\nResidual\n133482.237\n147 \n  908.042\n\n\n\n\nH2\nRegression\n239803.383\n  8 \n29975.423\n5.914\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH2\nResidual\n125481.246\n144 \n  871.398\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1: Happiness ~ Chocolate_Consumed_c + Type_of_Chocolate; N = 152\n\n\nH2: Happiness ~ Chocolate_Consumed_c * Type_of_Chocolate; N = 152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression Coefficients: Happiness\n\n\nModel\nTerm\nUnstandardized\nStandardized\nt\ndf\np\n\n\nb\n95% CI\nβ\n95% CI\nSE\n\n\n\n\nH1\n(Intercept)\n76.468\n66.808 — 86.129\n−0.306\n−0.601 — −0.010\n0.149\n15.643\n147 \n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH1\nChocolate_Consumed_c\n 2.801\n 1.577 — 4.024 \n 0.339\n 0.191 — 0.487 \n0.075\n 4.523\n147 \n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH1\nType_of_ChocolateMilk\n 5.000\n−8.662 — 18.662\n 0.153\n−0.265 — 0.571 \n0.211\n 0.723\n147 \n    0.471\n\n\nH1\nType_of_ChocolateDark\n15.000\n 1.338 — 28.662\n 0.459\n 0.041 — 0.876 \n0.211\n 2.170\n147 \n    0.032\n\n\nH1\nType_of_ChocolateAlcohol\n20.000\n 6.338 — 33.662\n 0.611\n 0.194 — 1.029 \n0.211\n 2.893\n147 \n    0.004\n\n\nH2\n(Intercept)\n76.468\n67.003 — 85.933\n−0.306\n−0.595 — −0.016\n0.146\n15.968\n144 \n&lt;0.001\n\n\nH2\nChocolate_Consumed_c\n 0.417\n−1.981 — 2.815 \n 0.050\n−0.240 — 0.341 \n0.147\n 0.343\n144 \n    0.732\n\n\nH2\nType_of_ChocolateMilk\n 5.000\n−8.386 — 18.386\n 0.153\n−0.256 — 0.562 \n0.207\n 0.738\n144 \n    0.462\n\n\nH2\nType_of_ChocolateDark\n15.000\n 1.614 — 28.386\n 0.459\n 0.049 — 0.868 \n0.207\n 2.215\n144 \n    0.028\n\n\nH2\nType_of_ChocolateAlcohol\n20.000\n 6.614 — 33.386\n 0.611\n 0.202 — 1.021 \n0.207\n 2.953\n144 \n    0.004\n\n\nH2\nChocolate_Consumed_c:Type_of_ChocolateMilk\n 1.282\n−2.109 — 4.673 \n 0.155\n−0.255 — 0.566 \n0.208\n 0.747\n144 \n    0.456\n\n\nH2\nChocolate_Consumed_c:Type_of_ChocolateDark\n 3.606\n 0.215 — 6.997 \n 0.437\n 0.026 — 0.847 \n0.208\n 2.102\n144 \n    0.037\n\n\nH2\nChocolate_Consumed_c:Type_of_ChocolateAlcohol\n 4.648\n 1.256 — 8.039 \n 0.563\n 0.152 — 0.973 \n0.208\n 2.709\n144 \n    0.008\n\n\n\n\nH1: Happiness ~ Chocolate_Consumed_c + Type_of_Chocolate; N = 152\n\n\nH2: Happiness ~ Chocolate_Consumed_c * Type_of_Chocolate; N = 152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand the nature of a moderation, it helps to plot the results.\nFigures - ggeffects and ggplot2\n\nThe most customizable way to plot model results is using the ggeffects and ggplot2 packages. We can use ggeffect() to get a data frame with estimated model values for specified terms in the model and the dependent variable.\nFor continuous variables, we can customize at what values we want to plot. For “all” possible values from the original data we can specify [all]. If your variable was standardized before entering it into the model you can use [2, 0, -2] to get values at +2 standard deviations above the mean, the mean, and -2 standard deviations below the mean.\n\nlibrary(ggeffects)\n\ndata_plot &lt;- ggeffect(model_moderation,\n                       terms = c(\"Chocolate_Consumed_c [all]\", \n                                 \"Type_of_Chocolate\")) |&gt;\n  rename(Chocolate_Consumed_c = x, Type_of_Chocolate = group,\n         Happiness = predicted)\n\nThis results in a data frame of estimated values from the model that we can now plot using ggplot2\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(data_plot, aes(Chocolate_Consumed_c, Happiness, \n                      color = Type_of_Chocolate)) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, \n                  fill = Type_of_Chocolate), \n              show.legend = FALSE, alpha = .1, color = NA) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", alpha = 0) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\",\n                     guide_legend(title = \"Type of Chocolate\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Amount of Chocolate Consumed\")\n## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures - sjPlot\n\nThe easiest way to plot the results of a moderation analysis is using the plot_model() function from the sjPlot package. Note that it is a bit more complicated to plot a moderation analysis when the moderator is a continuous variable instead of categorical but the sjPlot package actually makes it a bit easier.\n\nplot_model(model_moderation, typ = \"int\")",
