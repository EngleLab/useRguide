    "text": "What does reproducibility mean?\nReproducibility means that all data processing and analysis steps can be fully reproduced using only the original raw data files and the execution of the R scripts. There are different levels of reproducibility (I made these up):\n\nPartially reproducible - only some data processing and analysis steps can be reproduced, which may be due to a lack of original raw data files, the “just get it done” approach, or the use of proprietary and non-reproducible software.\nMinimally reproducible (acceptable) - all data processing and analysis steps can be reproduced on any research team members computer without any modifications needed.\nModerately reproducible (desired) - meets the minimal level plus other people not involved in the research project can reproduce the steps with minimal modifications.\nHighly reproducible (good luck!) - fully reproducible without major modifications needed by people not involved in the research project 5 - 10+ years from now.\n\nA minimal level of reproducibility is still acceptable, as achieving more requires significant time and effort. We should strive for a moderate amount of reproducibility but achieving it requires more than just writing code. Your code must be organized, easy to understand, and include notes and documentation. Even if you or someone else attempts to reproduce your steps in the future, they can modify the code to make it work. The highest level of reproducibility is difficult to achieve due to software and code updates. Your code may only work with the current version of R or other packages. There are solutions to this problem of software and code updates, but who knows if those will work in the future!\n\nSimply using R for data analysis does not guarantee that your workflow is reproducible. In fact, there are many non-reproducible ways to use R. To ensure at least a moderate level of reproducibility, consider the following criteria (this is not an exhaustive list):\n\nYour statistical analysis (the final step) can be fully reproduced from the raw data files and your R scripts\nYour code can be reproduced on other computers without any modifications\nYour data and R scripts are organized and documented in a way that makes them easily understandable\n\nThis last criterion is extremely important, but is often overlooked. If others cannot understand your workflow, then it is not moderately reproducible. Therefore, it is important to take the time and think about the organization of your project, files, data, and scripts.",

    "section": "Regression",
    "text": "Regression\nThe regression method requires multiple regression models because we have two dependent variables in the mode - the mediation and the outcome measure. The mediator acts as both an independent variable and dependent variable in the model. Because regression requires only one dependent variable, we cannot test the full model in one regression model. Instead, we have to test the different pieces of the model one at a time. We also need to perform a test on the indirect effect itself, which will require a separate model.\nIn order to evaluate the standardize coefficients (which is often times most useful), we need to first convert the the variables into z-scores. This is fairly straightforward but does require some extra code. A z-score is standardized score on the scale of standard deviation units and is calculated as:\nz-score = (raw score - mean) / sd\nWe can create new columns representing the z-scores using mutate() from the dplyr package.\n\ndata_mediation &lt;- happiness_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(Happiness_z = \n           (Happiness - mean(Happiness)) / sd(Happiness),\n         Social_Support_z = \n           (Social_Support - mean(Social_Support)) / sd(Social_Support),\n         Emotion_Regulation_z = \n           (Emotion_Regulation - mean(Emotion_Regulation)) / sd(Emotion_Regulation))\n\nThe standard regression model typically involves three regression models and a model testing the indirect effect.\n\nA model with the total effect: dv ~ iv\n\n\n\nreg_total &lt;- lm(Happiness_z ~ Social_Support_z, \n                data = data_mediation)\n\n\nA model with the effect of the predictor on the mediator: m ~ iv\n\n\n\nreg_med &lt;- lm(Emotion_Regulation_z ~ Social_Support_z, \n              data = data_mediation)\n\n\nA model with the direct effect and the effect of the mediator: dv ~ iv + m\n\n\n\nreg_direct &lt;- lm(Happiness_z ~ Emotion_Regulation_z + Social_Support_z, \n                 data = data_mediation)\n\n\nA statistical test of the indirect effect: mediation::mediate()\n\n\n\nmodel_mediation &lt;- mediation::mediate(reg_med, reg_direct,\n                                      treat = \"Social_Support_z\",\n                                      mediator = \"Emotion_Regulation_z\",\n                                      boot = TRUE, sims = 1000, \n                                      boot.ci.type = \"bca\")\n\n\n\neasystats\nmodeloutput\n\n\n\n1.
