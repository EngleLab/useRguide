There are three stages of processing and analyzing data in our lab

1.  **Data Preparation**: Convert messy raw data files into tidy raw data files
2.  **Data Scoring**: Calculate aggregate scores, clean data, remove outliers, and more
3.  **Data Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis and visualize data

All the steps in our data processing workflow can be fully reproduced with only the original raw data files and R scripts.

But first, we need to compile, organize, and store the raw data files.

# Compile Raw Data

Data is collected locally on running room computers in the lab, each with individual subject files for every session and task. The data is organized by session/task on each of these computers but we need to organize the folders just by /task and to also compile the data from all the computers in one location.

We use a `copy_to_drive.R` script to compile the raw data from all the computers onto a **Network Drive.**

# SharePoint - Data Collection

We use the **Network Drive** to [transfer]{.underline} data files to the lab's **SharePoint**, where the data will be permanently stored. A SharePoint/Data Collection/\[Study Name\] directory is where ALL the raw data files for that data collection effort are stored.
