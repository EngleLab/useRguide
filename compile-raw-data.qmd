There are three stages of processing and analyzing data in our lab

1.  **Data Preparation**: Convert messy raw data files into tidy raw data files
2.  **Data Scoring**: Calculate aggregate scores, clean data, remove outliers, and more
3.  **Data Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis and visualize data

All the steps in our data processing workflow can be fully reproduced with only the original raw data files and R scripts.

But first, we need to compile, organize, and store the raw data files.

# Compile Raw Data

Data is collected locally on running room computers in the lab. Each computer will have a different combination of data from each subject and session number. On the running room computers the data is organized by **session** / **task**

📁 Session 1

     📁 1. OSpan

     📁 2. RAPM

     📁 3. Antisaccade

     📁 And so on

📁 Session 2

📁 Session 3

📁 Session 4

Ideally, we want the data organized just by **task** (we also like to get rid of the number in the folder name). And each task folder to have all the data from all subjects that have participated.

📁 OSpan

📁 RAPM

📁 Antisaccade

We use a `copy_to_drive.R` script to compile the raw data from all the computers onto a **Network Drive** and at the same time reorgnize the data by **task**.

::: callout-note
You can find a template for the `copy_to_drive.R` script file on the Network Drive
:::

The template looks something link:

```{r}
#| eval: false



```

# SharePoint - Data Collection

Link to [SharePoint](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/sites/cos/psychology/engle-lab/Shared%20Documents/Forms/All%20Items.aspx){target="_blank"}

We use the **Network Drive** simply to [transfer]{.underline} data files to the lab's **SharePoint**, where the data will be permanently stored. A SharePoint/Data Collection/\[Study Name\] directory is where ALL the raw data files for that data collection effort are stored.

The organization of data files and scripts looks something like:

📁 **data**

     📁 **raw** (created from \_raw.R scripts)

           📄 OSpan_raw.csv

           📄 RAPM_raw.csv

           📄 Antisaccade_raw.csv

           📁 **messy** (original files created from task program)

                 📁 OSpan

                       📄 OSpan_subjID.txt

                 📁 RAPM

                 📁 Antisaccade

📁 **R**

     📄 OSpan_raw.R

     📄 RAPM_raw.R

     📄 Antisaccade_raw.R
