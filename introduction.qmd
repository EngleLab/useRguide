# Introduction {.unnumbered}

There is considerable learning curve for any programming language, R is no different. The first section will cover the fundamentals that you will need to do anything in R, starting with installing the appropriate software.

You should use your own computer for this useRguide instead of a lab computer.

You should let the graduate students in the lab know if you are learning R and using this guide that way they know whether you have these skills. This is a great way to start getting more involved in the lab as this allows graduate students to give you more tasks to do.

## Navigation

You can navigate this useRguide using the **left side bar**. Within each chapter there will be a table of contents on the **right side bar** that you can use to navigate.

The **top menu navigation bar** has convenient links to the lab website, the lab manual, and documentation on R packages that were developed in this lab.

## Section Contents

The [Getting Started](#sec-r-and-rstudio) section covers how to install and update software, introduce the basics of how R works, and more.

The [Tidyverse](#sec-this-is-the-way) section is a general introduction to working with data in R using the Tidyverse set of packages.

The [Data Processing](#sec-data-processing-steps) section will cover data processing steps in a way that are specific to our lab.

The [Data Visualization](#sec-introduction-to-ggplot2) section will introduce different ways of plotting data using the ggplot2 package.

The [Statistical Analysis](#sec-regression) section will introduce how to perform certain statistical analyses in R.

We use R at every stage of processing data from tidying up messy raw data files to generating statistical and graphical reports.
